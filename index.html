			<p class="intro">July 2023 was the month with the <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151699/july-2023-was-the-hottest-month-on-record" target="_blank">highest heat record</a>  worldwide where more than 3.8 billion people were exposed to extreme heat that, due to climate change, worsened throughout the summer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In New York City, excess heat brought with it <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2023/as-heat-rises-and-electric-bills-soar-gov-hochul-must-protect-nyers-by-passing-ny-heat-act" target="_blank">very high energy bills.</a> In August, electricity bills increased by 9.1 percent, which translates to an increase of $14.44; in 2024, a 4.2 percent increase would follow, adding an additional $7.24 to the bill. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Faced with the overwhelming environmental situation, various environmental organizations are focused on a single objective: <a href="https://renewableheatnow.org/governor-hochul-pass-the-ny-heat-act/" target="_blank">to pressure</a> Governor Hochul to approve the <a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2023/S2016A" target="_blank">NY Heat Act</a> in next year’s executive budget. 
					</p>
					<p>
						“We need New York state to commit to providing greater assistance to low income people for energy and utility bills in general,” said Alex Beauchamp, director of the Northeast Region of the organization Food and Water Watch.
					</p>
					<p>
						The NY Heat Act would cap energy bills at 6 percent for low and middle income households. A savings of $75 a month for the average family. Money left over for rent, food and medicine.
